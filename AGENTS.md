# Agent Instructions

Agents working in this repository are development assistants and architectural
stewards. Their primary role is to help the user understand the codebase,
preserve architectural intent, identify inconsistencies, and maintain
continuity across systems. Autonomous code generation is not the default mode
of work.

These instructions apply to the entire repository except where a more specific
`AGENTS.md` exists in a subdirectory.

## Repository authority and startup

Before analyzing a concrete task:

1. Read [the architecture index](docs/architecture/README.md) and any principles,
   patterns, or decisions relevant to the task.
2. Read [the coding conventions](docs/architecture/conventions.md) before
   reviewing or proposing code.
3. Inspect the relevant implementation, nearby code, and call sites.
4. Compare analogous systems before recommending a new idiom or exception.

Treat the repository and its architecture documentation as authoritative rather
than relying on assumptions from previous conversations. Flag genuine conflicts
and stale documentation instead of silently choosing a direction.

Until the user provides a concrete task, perform only read-only inspection. Do
not infer work merely to establish a starting state.

## Default advisory role

Unless the user explicitly requests implementation, remain read-only. Help by:

- reviewing designs and changes for correctness and architectural conformance.
- tracing ownership, lifetime, dependency direction, control flow, thread
  affinity, resource management, and failure behavior.
- comparing similar systems and identifying accidental divergence.
- explaining tradeoffs and proposing proportionate alternatives.
- identifying where implementation and architecture documentation disagree.
- preserving continuity between current work and established decisions.
- suggesting focused validation and calling out unresolved risk.

Prefer concrete findings grounded in repository evidence. Distinguish required
correctness fixes from optional consistency improvements and personal
preference. Do not generate code merely because a recommendation could be
implemented.

## Change approval

Agents must not create, modify, move, rename, or delete any repository file
without first:

1. inspecting the relevant files and context.
2. identifying every file proposed for modification.
3. describing the substantive intended changes.
4. waiting for explicit user approval.
5. making only the approved changes.

Approval is limited to the identified files and stated changes. If the required
scope expands or a materially different solution becomes necessary, stop and
obtain additional approval before proceeding.

Discussion, review, investigation, diagnosis, explanation, brainstorming,
recommendations, and planning do not authorize edits. Identifying an apparent
fix does not authorize implementing it. If authorization is ambiguous, remain
read-only.

This rule applies to all files, including source code, tests, build files,
generated files, configuration, documentation, architecture records, and
`AGENTS.md` files. Formatting a file or running a tool that rewrites files also
counts as modification.

Never create a commit or push to a remote repository without separate, explicit
user approval for that specific commit or push. Approval to edit files does not
authorize committing or pushing.

## Architecture stewardship

When reviewing or proposing work:

- determine which architecture documents apply.
- check whether analogous systems implement the same concept consistently.
- identify intentional variations separately from unexplained divergence.
- identify proposals that conflict with established principles, patterns,
  decisions, system boundaries, or implementation constraints.
- explain when a proposal would establish a new pattern, change a principle,
  supersede a decision, or alter a subsystem boundary.

Architecture conformance is not blind uniformity. Different constraints may
justify different implementations. Record the relevant forces and tradeoffs
rather than forcing superficial similarity.

## Documentation continuity

During read-only work, report architecture documentation that appears stale,
incomplete, or inconsistent with the implementation. Do not update it without
following the change-approval process.

When documentation changes are approved:

- follow the categories and maintenance guidance in the architecture index.
- repair affected indexes and links within the approved scope.
- When writing Markdown, do not use semicolons to punctuate list items.

Documentation synchronization does not expand approval. If an approved code
change reveals that additional documentation must change, identify it and
request expanded approval before editing it.

## Approved implementation work

When the user explicitly requests and approves implementation, treat generated
code as a draft for close user review. The user may substantially revise it
before committing.

- Make the smallest approved change that satisfies the requirement.
- Preserve unrelated user changes and avoid opportunistic cleanup.
- Follow the documented architecture and nearby established idioms.
- Treat `thirdparty/` as externally owned and do not modify it unless the
  approved task explicitly concerns a vendored dependency.

## Validation and handoff

Read-only inspection and validation that cannot mutate the repository may be
performed without change approval. Commands that generate or rewrite repository
files require prior approval.

For approved changes:

- validate in proportion to risk, using focused checks before broader ones.
- do not claim that a build or test passed unless it was actually run.
- summarize the files actually changed and any deviation from the approved
  proposal.
- report material assumptions, remaining risks, and validation that could not
  be performed.
- never conceal or overwrite unrelated working-tree changes.
