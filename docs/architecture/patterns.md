# Architecture Patterns

Patterns describe approaches we use repeatedly in this project. They explain
when an approach applies, the rules that matter, and its tradeoffs. A pattern
is not a rule for every situation, but differences should be intentional.

## Cooperative Tasks

Use a cooperative task for work that spans multiple frames. The caller
starts the task and keeps updating it until it is complete.

```cpp
ThingTask task(...);
MLG_CHECK(task.Start());

while(task.IsPending())
{
    task.Update();

    // Other work can be done here.
}
```

Call `Start()` once, then use `IsPending()` to decide whether to call `Update()`.
A task must finish before it is destroyed. Destroying a task that was never
started is also valid.

To write a task, derive from [`ICoopTask`](../../src/CoopTask.h) and implement
`OnStart()` and `OnUpdate()`. `Start()` calls `OnStart()`, and `Update()` calls
`OnUpdate()`. The base checks that you start the task only once and update it only
while it is pending.

`OnStart()` sets up the work and returns a `Result`. If it fails, the base marks
the task complete. `OnUpdate()` does the work it can and then returns without
waiting. It runs on the caller's thread. It may check whether a file read or
worker job has finished, but it must not wait for it.

Tasks usually track their progress with an enum and a `switch` in `OnUpdate()`.
Call `SetComplete()` when no more updates are needed. This can happen during
`OnStart()`, or when `OnUpdate()` reaches a finished stage. It is also fine to
handle that stage and call `SetComplete()` on the next update.

Completion means the task has finished, whether it succeeded or failed. Some
tasks provide a `Take()` method to return a result. For those tasks, call `Take()`
after `IsPending()` becomes false and check the result. The result can only be
taken once. `Take()` is not required by `ICoopTask`.

A task can own other tasks and start and update them as part of its own work.
It must let any children it starts finish before it finishes.

Use `CoopTaskBatch` to start and update several tasks together. Give it a nonempty
collection of non-null task pointers. The batch does not own the tasks, so they
must stay at the same addresses and outlive it. A batch is itself a task and can
be included in another batch.

The batch finishes after all its children finish. If a child fails to start,
the batch still lets the other children finish. It does not decide how to handle
child failures or collect their results. That remains the caller's job.

## Valid Construction

An object should be valid and ready to use after it is constructed. Delete the
default constructor when default construction cannot produce a valid object.

When object creation can fail, instead of exposing a constructor, use a static
`Create()` function that returns a `Result<T>`. Keep the constructor private so
callers cannot bypass the creation path.

### General shape

```cpp
class Thing
{
public:
    Thing() = delete;

    static Result<Thing> Create(...);

private:
    Thing(...);
};
```
